## Overview

This example demonstrates how you can build a Docker image and push it to Artifactory. The image built in this example can be used as a base custom image for Pipelines, since it fulfills all requirements listed in [the docs](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Choosing+your+Runtime+Image#ChoosingyourRuntimeImage-MinimumRequirementsforLinux).
